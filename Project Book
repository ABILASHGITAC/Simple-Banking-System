Project Book: Basic Banking System

1. **Introduction:**
   - The Basic Banking System project aims to create a simple banking application that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
   - This project will serve as a fundamental exercise in object-oriented programming, data handling, and user interface design.

2. **Project Objectives:**
   - Develop a Python program to simulate a basic banking system.
   - Implement classes and methods to manage user accounts, transactions, and data storage.
   - Create a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the banking system.
   - Ensure data security by securely handling user credentials and account information.

3. **Technologies Used:**
   - Python programming language
   - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code

4. **Project Structure:**
   - **Main File:** `basic_banking_system.py`
     - Contains the main code for the banking system.
   - **Data Storage Module:** `data_storage.py`
     - Handles the storage and retrieval of customer data using dictionaries.
   - **User Interface Module:** `user_interface.py`
     - Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the banking system.
   - **Documentation:** `README.md`
     - Provides instructions for running the program and an overview of its functionalities.

5. **Functionalities:**
   - **Account Creation:**
     - Users can create a new account by providing their name, password, and initial deposit amount.
   - **Login:**
     - Existing users can log in using their user ID and password.
   - **Deposit:**
     - Users can deposit money into their accounts.
   - **Withdrawal:**
     - Users can withdraw money from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance.
   - **Balance Inquiry:**
     - Users can check their account balance at any time.
   - **Data Security:**
     - User credentials and account information are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests will be conducted to ensure the correctness and reliability of each module and functionality.
   - Test cases will cover various scenarios such as valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and error handling.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Inline comments and docstrings will be included in the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each component.
   - A README file will provide detailed instructions for setting up and running the program.

8. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Integration with a database for persistent data storage.
   - Implementation of additional features such as fund transfer and transaction history.
   - Improving the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The Basic Banking System project aims to provide a foundation for understanding basic banking operations and object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
   - By completing this project, participants will gain practical experience in developing real-world applications and handling user data securely.
